        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p><em>A brief introduction to my background, why I want to learn coding, and what my other hobbies are.</em></p><br>

        <h2><strong>Background</strong></h2>
        <p>I graduated from <span class="highlight">Linfield College</span> in 2017. Afterwards I went to Japan to teach English <span class="highlight">through the JET programme.</span> I had studied Spanish and Japanese throughout high school and college, which helped immensely with the immersion process. I lived in a "small" town called <span class="highlight">Oita</span>, which is a place the Japanese call the boonies, but the city has a population a little over 200,000. Their comparison is Tokyo so I suppose it's understandable. I lived in Oita for <span class="highlight">two years</span>, after which I returned to Oregon.<br><br>
          I had majored in political science while in college, but decided that I didn't want to entire the political world, so I have been giving <span class="highlight">marketing</span> a try. I currently work at a digital marketing company, which is partially the reason why I wanted to pick up coding. <span class="highlight">I have also always wanted to create my own app at some point.</span> I occasionally run across a situation where I think an app would be useful, but the perfect or ideal app doesn't exist. It might also be fun to try a hand at creating games.</p>
